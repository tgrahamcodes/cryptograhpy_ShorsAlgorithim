## Shor's Quantum Factorization

Simulate the index finding algorithm in Shorâ€™s quantum factorization algorithm for the following RSA moduli

1. n = 15
2. n=143

After each major step in Shor's Algorithm, plot the state of the quantum register (amplitude only). 

Notes:

Since you are simulating a special-purpose quantum device using a classical computer, you will quickly run out of cycles. Choose the number of qubits to simulate Shor's Algorithm carefully, i.e., small enough not to run out of cycles and large enough to at least observe the period several times.
